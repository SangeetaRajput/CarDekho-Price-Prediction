# CarDekho-Price-Prediction

# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars based on various features such as mileage, year of manufacture, fuel type, and brand. By leveraging historical data from CarDekho.com, the model aims to provide actionable insights for buyers, sellers, and the broader used car market in India.

# Objectives

• Develop an accurate machine learning model for predicting used car prices.

• Enhance pricing transparency and market efficiency in the Indian used car space.
